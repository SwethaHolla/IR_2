# Information Retrieval – Exercise 2

This notebook is part of the MSc Data Science coursework for the Information Retrieval module at the University of Glasgow. It focuses on advanced retrieval techniques, evaluation metrics, and relevance-based ranking.

### 🧠 Key Topics

- BM25 scoring for ranked retrieval
- Mean Average Precision (MAP) and NDCG evaluation
- Document scoring and ranking
- Query processing and relevance feedback

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- `numpy`, `pandas`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- IR-specific functions and scoring methods

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Implement and evaluate ranking algorithms like BM25  
- Use evaluation metrics (MAP, NDCG) to assess system performance  
- Understand the trade-offs in different retrieval approaches
